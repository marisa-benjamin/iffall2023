                <h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>I am unwritten, can't read my mind
<br>I'm undefined
<br>I'm just beginning, 
<br>the pen's in my hand
<br>Ending unplanned</p>

<h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
<p>Staring at the blank page before you
    <br>Open up the dirty window
    <br>Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
    <br>Reaching for something in the distance
    <br>o close you can almost taste it
    <br>Release your inhibitions</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p>
Feel the rain on your skin
<br>No one else can feel it for you
<br>Only you can let it in
<br>No one else, no one else
<br>Can speak the words on your lips
<br>Drench yourself in words unspoken
<br>Live your life with arms wide open
<br>Today is where your book begins
<br>The rest is still unwritten, yeah
<br>Oh, oh</p>


<h2>Verse 2</h2>
<p>
    I break tradition
    <br>Sometimes my tries, 
    <br>are outside the lines, yeah
    <br>We've been conditioned 
    <br>to not make mistakes
    <br>But I can't live that way, 
    <br>no, oh</p>

<h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
<p>
    Staring at the blank page before you
    <br>Open up the dirty window
    <br>Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
    <br>Reaching for something in the distance
    <br>So close you can almost taste it
    <br>elease your inhibitions</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p>Feel the rain on your skin
<br>No one else can feel it for you
<br>Only you can let it in
<br>No one else, no one else
<br>Can speak the words on your lips
<br>Drench yourself in words unspoken
<br>Live your life with arms wide open
<br>Today is where your book begins
<br>Feel the rain on your skin
<br>No one else can feel it for you
<br>Only you can let it in
<br>No one else, no one else
<br>Can speak the words on your lips
<br>Drench yourself in words unspoken
<br>Live your life with arms wide open
<br>Today is where your book begins
<br>The rest is still unwritten</p>

<h2>Outro</h2>
<p>The rest is still unwritten
    <br>The rest is still unwritten
    <br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
