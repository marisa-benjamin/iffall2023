                <h3 style="text-align: left;">Ingredients & Tools</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;"> 
                    4 pieces of bacon
                    <br> 2 potatoes
                    <br>Any vegetables of your liking, I prefer using 1 onion and 1 pepper
                    <br> 1/2 cup of cheese 
                <h4>Tools:</h4>
                <p>Nonstick skillet or cast iron pan
                <br>Spatula
                <br>Separate skillet for eggs
                <br>Slotted spoon</p>

                
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol type = "1">
                    <p><li> <b>Put bacon in skillet </b>- Cook the bacon until it’s nice and crispy and the fat has rendered. This just means that the fat has been separated from the bacon. The less fat in the bacon, the crispier it is, so cook it to your preferred crunchiness. 
                       
                    <br>Once it’s done, put the bacon on a paper towel and leave some fat in the skillet.</li></p>
                        
                    <p><li> <b>Load the skillet with your diced potatoes</b> and cook until they’re good and golden.
                    </li></p>

                    <p><li>Now it’s time to <b>add veggies</b> -the onions and peppers to the potatoes. </li></p>

                    <p><li> Return the bacon to the pan and add in the flavor: 
                    <br><b>Mix in the cream</b>, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, salt, and pepper. <br>Then <b>mix everything well</b>, letting it simmer over low heat until thickened.</li></p>
               
                    <p><li> Cut the heat and <b>add the cheese and green onions</b>. Then watch it turn into melty, gooey goodness while you fry up your eggs.</li></p>
                    
                    <p><li> Spoon out the hash and eggs and <i style="color: rgb(221, 78, 78);" > <b>dig in!</b></i></li></p>

                    <p>"Just made this for lunch for my husband and me (really procrastinating when you make a decadent breakfast dish in the middle of a work day). It was delicious and we had to force ourselves to put the leftovers in the fridge. However, when I poured in the cream I lost all the pretty color in the potatoes and veggies - it looked like gray mush. Not pretty like you photo, but amazingly delicious. Maybe I put in too much cream?"</p>

                    <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/search/bread"> Epicurious:</a> Epicurious does a great job with easily displaying what the rating of each recipe is, and allowing for quick selection necessary criteria (like cooking time and skill level). I really enjoy the large search bar in the middle of the homepage.

                    <a href="https://pinchofyum.com/"> Pinch of Yum:</a> This website is so aesthetically pleasing. I really enjoy how each of the pictures of the recipe are in line with one another and how there are  little boxes underneath the pictures offering creative cooking categories like fall food. I would love to learn how to make a "banner" like that or how to put pictures in line.</div>

                    <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/"> The Minimalist Baker:</a> This website is fairly similar to Pinch of Yum, as they both have click-able pictures at the top of the homepage... but what I really like about Minimalist Baker is the pick of the week sections. The slightly darker boc surrounding the pick of the week draws your eye directly to the recipe. I also really like the picture right aligned.

I love how the dishes rotate around the page as the viewer scrolls. I also love the color scheme. I want to use this as inspiration for my recipe page and make "interactive" portions.
