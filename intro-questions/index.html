        <ol type = "1">
            <li>My name is Marisa Benjamin, I am a junior studying Accounting and Communication Design. </li>
            <li>My background: I have always loved graphic design and photography. I have no experience with html but have enjoyed creating websites through website editors, like WIX. I wanted to challenge myself.</li>
            <li>I unfortunately have no prior experience with HTML, CSS, or JS </li>
            <li>I hope to learn the basics of coding and how to efficiently code. I feel it is a great skill to have.</li>
            <li>I think designing for a screen may be different because you have to take into account the different platforms viewers may be looking at your website from. IT it importanat to take into account how the website design changes will different sized tabs.</li>
            <li><a href="https://fan-ton.com/">Effective design Website: FanTON.</a > Over the summer, I preformed a sports technology industry analysis and stumble across FanTON, which creates NFT playing cards. I think the website design is incredible effective, the way the text pops up as the viewer scrolls is engaging, the color scheme provides the same excitement as watching sports, and the scrolling playing cards at the top of the homepage display the product in a very cool way.</li>
            <li><a href="https://decorsystems.com.au/">Effective Communication Website: ARCHITECTURAL ACOUSTIC SOLUTIONS</a> I think this website does a beautiful job communicating what architectural acoustic systems do; it shares a short sentence about the goal of the company, immediately follow by picture examples of the solutions they have provided to clients. It is very clean and simple and effectively communicates the mission of the company. </li>   
            <li><a href="https://www.bikebear.com.my/">Website that works well: Bike Bear </a> I stumbled on this website when looking for creative website design and immediately fell in love with how creative the approach to scrolling and having the website feel animated and come alive is. I really enjoy how fun this website it, it's truly captivating.</li>
